# Google Calendar Generator

This webapp allows a user create a new Google Calendar starting at any given date by uploading a formatted uploaded Excel file. Events can be separated on different sheets and should include event start time, title, and description. For a sample input file, see [Schedule.xlsx](./dist/Schedule.xlsx). This utility was written to automate creating the Counterpoint Training Calendar for new hires. It uses Webpack as its JavaScript module bundler.
